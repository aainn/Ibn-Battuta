                </span>), is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers
                an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate.
                With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. Germany's
                capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres
                of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart,
                Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover, and Nuremberg.</p>
            <p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region
                named Germania was documented before 100&nbsp;AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded
                southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire.
                During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the
                collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of
                1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.</p>
            <p>In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German
                Empire. After World War I and the revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar
                Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II and
                the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states
                were founded: West Germany, formed of the American, British and French occupation zones, and East Germany,
                formed of the Soviet occupation zone. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central
                and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.</p>
            <p>In the 21st century, Germany is a great power with a strong economy; it has the world's 4th largest economy by
                nominal GDP, and the 5th largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors,
                it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. A developed country with a very high
                standard of living, it upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection,
                and a tuition-free university education.</p>
            <p>The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community in 1957 and the European
                Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is
                a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD. Known for its rich cultural history,
                Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople,
                entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.
